      <p>
      I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building efficient, user-friendly applications. Beyond web development, I have hands-on experience in robotics and leading projects like an autonomous VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft. I enjoy automating processes and continuously exploring new technologies to create innovative solutions that blend software with hardware.
